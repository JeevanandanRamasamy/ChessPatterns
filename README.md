# Are there any Patterns in Chess Match Results?

## Background

As a data enthusiast, I am fascinated by the application of Data Science to gain insight about the world. I also enjoy playing Chess during my free time. In this project, I explore the results of a Chess match, from the number of turns taken to the type of victory. Does white take more turns to win? Or does black take more turns to win? How long does it take for a match to end in a draw? This data is collected from lichess.org, an online chess platform. Players in lichess.org, as with most online chess websites, are ranked based on their rating. In this project, I also test whether the ratings are accurate. In other words, does higher rating mean that the player will win another match?

## Data

The dataset I am using in this blog comes from Kaggle. The data was collected from over 20000 Chess matches in lichess.org using an API that returns information from the website. The data consists of few (not all) clusters of players in lichess.org. This dataset has variables such as number of turns, type of victory, winner, rating of player white, etc. The purpose of this dataset is to give insight into patterns commonly found across chess game results. Using these results, we can predict whether a player will win a match or not.
